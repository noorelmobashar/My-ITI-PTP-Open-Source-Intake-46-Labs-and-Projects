			My dog Sasha is my best friend. She likes to choose
			<br>
			the soccer ball when I practice. It is so funny to 
			<br>
			see her running down the field trying to catch the 
			<br>
			ball with her mouth. It just won't fit!

		Once Sasha saved my life. When I was only 4 years old. I started to go into
		the street to get a ball that
		<br>
		had rolled across the street. Of course I did not think to look for cars! 
		Sasha got in front of me and
		<br>
		knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk. I was mad until I saw the car go by
		where I would have been 
		<br>
		Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than i was!/
